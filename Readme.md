# Activity Objectives

Review data sources used for developing housing and transportation tools
and indices. Students will get familiar with the data utilized in
understanding these topics and get familiar with reporting on data
sources. This assignment will introduce adding mathematical formula into
markdown files.

# Requirements

Students should...

-   Have access to the [Housing & Economic Data
    Sources](https://iowastate.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/DSPG2024/Shared%20Documents/General/DSPG%20Economic%20Data%20Sources.pptx?d=w003e8990ab2243cc8ed7936dd95f06c0&csf=1&web=1&e=H7EIxN){target="_blank"}
    presentation.
    -   Presentation can be found in the files tab of the General chat
        for the DSPG Teams Organization.
-   Go through the slides if they weren't available for the
    presentation.

# Assignment Details

Liesl Eathington's presentation on housing and other socio-demographic
data sources shared the two following tools and indices.

-   [Housing Solutions Matchmaker
    Tool](https://www.naco.org/resources/housing-solutions-matchmaker-tool#tool){target="_blank"}
-   [The Housing and Transportation (H+TÂ®) Affordability
    Index](https://htaindex.cnt.org/){target="_blank"}

These two tools are developed using data collected by different
organizations across the US. The goal of this assignment will be to
review these two tools and to document the different data sources that
are used in creating these products. The data sources utilized in these
tools will also be sources of data that you will frequently interact
with.

The following are links to the methodologies of the two tools.

-   [The Housing Policy Matchmaker Methodology
    Appendix](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-housing-policy-matchmaker-methodology-appendix/){target="_blank"}
-   [H+T Index
    Methods](https://htaindex.cnt.org/about/method-2022.pdf){target="_blank"}

# Submission Details

Students should document the data sets in a format where they can
associate the data to the element of the tool or index they are
creating. An example might be the following.

### Auto Ownership

The H+T index uses data on auto ownership obtained from the 2019 ACS.
The specific survey is the 2015-2019 ACS 5-Year Estimate data.

Choose at least one formula from the documentation and try to recreate
it for one of the data indices. These are created using LaTex Math
syntax.

$\textit{Value to Income} = \frac{\textit{County median home value 2019}} {\textit{Metro area median income 2019}}$
